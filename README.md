# NetNavi Explorer

## Introduction
Welcome to NetNavi Explorer, an immersive web application inspired by the iconic Mega Man Battle Network series. This project aims to bring the digital world of ACDC Town to life, allowing visitors to explore the game's rich lore and characters through an interactive map. Navigate through the town, discover information about the main characters by clicking on their homes, delve into the vast array of Battle Chips at Higsby's Shop, and communicate directly with your very own NetNavi via a personalized PET interface.
